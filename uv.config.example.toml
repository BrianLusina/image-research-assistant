# Example uv configuration (example only)
# Adjust to your environment. `uv` uses `pyproject.toml` by default
# so this file is only a sample to show common options.

[uv]
# Minimum Python version used by contributors when creating virtualenvs
python = "3.10"

# Optional extra install arguments the project may want to document
# extras = ["dev"]

# Example of custom install command suggestions (not a uv native key)
# Use this section to document any repository-specific uv flags you expect
# contributors to run. Example usage:
#   uv install -r pyproject.toml
# or
#   uv run pip install -e .

# End of example
